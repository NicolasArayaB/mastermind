## Mastermind
***
### General Info

If you’ve never played Mastermind, a game where you have to guess your opponent’s secret code within a certain number of turns (like hangman with colored pegs).
Each turn you get some feedback about how good your guess was – whether it was exactly correct or just the correct color but in the wrong space.

### Assigment

Build a Mastermind game from the command line where you have 12 turns to guess the secret code, starting with you guessing the computer’s random code.
